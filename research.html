								<h3>An introduction on Dark Matter</h3>
                                
                               
                                
                                <p> Cosmology is the study of the Universe as a whole, its past, present and fate. The rigorous scientific and modern approach of this subject only begun in the 1920’s with new powerful observational devices allowing for better and better precision, and when physicists started to fully appropriate Einstein’s General Relativity as a tool to understand the dynamics of the entire Universe. Indeed, using this theory, Alexander Friedmann proposed in 1922 that the Universe had to be in an ongoing expansion. Two years later, in 1924, thanks to the new Hooker telescope of Mount Wilson, Edwin Hubble understood that many object in space that were taken to be nebula were in fact galaxies far beyond our own Milky-Way and he measured their velocities. Then, in 1927 Georges Lemaitre independently found the same result than Friedmann and with Hubble observations he was able to give an approximation of the expansion rate. Eventually, in 1929 Hubble gave a more precise value for this rate and what is now called the Hubble expansion law. Since then modern cosmology has build on these breaktrhough and has been in constant evolution thanks to better and better instruments and experiments. Today, the best description of our Universe today is provided by a model with two puzzling ingredients: dark energy and dark matter (herafter denoted DM). Understanding their nature is therefore a key goal of modern physics. In the following we focus on the DM issue.  </p>
                                
                                <p> From the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> century physicists have tried to evaluate the mass of dark bodies or dark stars (i.e. massive, non luminous matter) in the solar neighborhood. In 1906 Henri Poincaré coined the generic denomination <i> matière sombre </i> (dark matter in english). Following the work of lord Kelvin on the kinetic of gaz applied to gravitationally bound stellar systems he postulated that the mass of <i> matière sombre </i> had to be inferior than the mass of luminous matter.</p>
                                    
                                    <blockquote> Il y a les étoiles que nous voyons parce qu'elles brillent; mais ne pourrait-il y avoir des astres obscurs qui circulent dans les espaces interstellaires et dont l'existence pourrait rester longtemps ignorée ? Mais alors, ce que nous donnerait la méthode de lord Kelvin, ce serait le nombre total des étoiles, en y comprenant les étoiles obscures; comme son chiffre est comparable a celui que donne le téléscope, c'est qu'il n'y a pas de <b> matière obscure </b>, ou du moins qu'il n'y en a pas tant que de matière brillante. - Henri Poincaré <i>La Voie lactée et la théorie des gaz, 1906 </i> </blockquote>
                                
                                <p> However this computation suffered from large uncertainties and as he pointed out, this result was only a mere order of magnitude. Therefore one often says that the problem of DM appeared three decades later, in 1933 when the astrophysicist Fritz Zwicky, who was interested in the Coma galaxy cluster, tried to infer its mass. He provided then different estimates obtained with two kinds of methods, in the vein of the studies made by lord Kelvin, Poincaré and others in the local environment so far. On the one hand, he used a dynamical estimate from the measurement of the galaxies velocity dispersion and based on the law of gravitation. On the other hand he evaluated the mass of luminous visible matter (via the mass-luminosity relation) in the cluster. Unexpectedly the two resulting masses came out to be different by two orders of magnitude [1,2] and according to Zwicky, this was a hint for the possible existence of <i> dunkle materie </i> (translation of dark matter in german) lying inside the cluster. Although this was the first experimental appearance of DM, this discovery did not receive much credits because most physicists were still concerned by the measurement errors. The issue became pressing only in the 1970’s when Vera Rubin and Kent Ford measured the velocity of stars in spiral galaxies and discovered that the result was once again different than the prediction made by the law of gravitation: stars on the outer arms had higher velocities than expected [3]. Rubin concluded in 1980 that these galaxies should contain around 80% of DM and only 20% of luminous matter to explain the observations [55]. From this point forward the problem of DM was finally considered a major issue of physics. Today we know that introducing DM into the theoretical models could explain many more cosmological and astrophysical observations such as the inhomogeneities in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) [2, 59], the Big-Bang nucleosyn- thesis (BBN), the formation of structures such as galaxies and cluster of galaxies [44], gravitational lensing effects [29] etc. No known form of matter could play the role of DM (e.g. the BBN and CMB constraints). There is little doubt on its existence and as mentioned earlier, understanding its nature is an important key to understand the Universe. </p>
                                
                                <p> Therefore there are two possibilities to tackle the DM problem. The first one is to state that, in fact, Einstein’s law of gravitation is not valid for large length scales and should be modified or replaced. With this point of view DM does not really exist and our misunderstanding of gravity itself is the cause of all the abnormal observations. However, finding an accurate and physically acceptable modification is a real challenge and generally require the introduction of new degree of freedom for the new fundamental thoery of gravity to work. One could mention for instance the empirical theoretical proposal MOND (for MOdified Newtonian Dynamics) [54] that relies on this eventuality but whose "covariantization" remains a very challenging task [17, 23, 31]. The second way to think of this problem is to introduce DM as new massive particles: "non baryonic particles". It could be particles predicted by Standard Model (SM) extensions: supersymmetry, Kaluza-Klein theories, string theory, etc, or particles introduced to solve more specific problems like axions or massive neutrinos. Not to forget that it could also be made of other exotic, while macroscopic, objects, like primordial black holes [27]. Today DM particles are actively searched through different strategies, exemplified by a series of experiments or observational programs, e.g.: EDELWEISS [5,8], CDMS [1]/SuperCDMS [3], XENON1T [4], AMS02, Gaia [36], Fermi [6]. On the one hand there are the direct detection experiments which try to find DM through its interaction with classical SM matter, assuming that such an interaction exists. On the other hand the indirect detection goal is to find the possible by-products, such as photons or comsic rays, of the DM annihilation into SM particles, coming from different structures (the Milky Way, the dwarf galaxies, the galaxy clusters, ...). </p>
                                
                                <p> In the commonly accepted paradigm DM is said to be cold - according to observational requirements set on its velocity at given key moments of its history in the Universe. One then talk about the cold-DM (CDM) scenario. However, althouth it is successful to explain the structures on galactic scales and beyond, there are still some issues on subgalactic scales [25], the most famous ones being : Cusp/Core, Missing Satellites, and Too-Big-to-Fail problems [20]. At this scales baryonic physics may also play an important role but today the underlying physics is not sufficiently known to give precise answers. That make crucial the detailed understanding of the structuring of DM and related observational consequences on these scales. This may lead to additional constraints or discovery perspectives for CDM candidates.</p>

                                <h3 id="two"> My Research Projects</h3>
                                
                                <p>The presence of Dark matter (DM) is established from gravitational probes on cosmological down to galactic scales. DM may be interpreted either as the existence of an additional exotic component of non-relativistic matter or as the need to revise General Relativity. The exotic matter interpretation leads to a successful theory of structure formation, and is one of the pillars of the Λ-cold-DM (ΛCDM) cosmological scenario. The latter might fail on subgalactic scales (e.g. Bullock et al. 2017), but this is pending to a better understanding of baryonic physics and could anyway be cured by equipping DM with specific properties (e.g. self-interactions). Predicting/observing (the consequences of) the clustering properties of DM on subgalactic scales is therefore an interesting way to tell DM candidates apart; in particular whether they form cusps in galactic halos and/or populate them with DM subhalos. Many particle scenarios beyond the standard model (BSM) can lead to DM particle candidates, among which axions and WIMPs (and derivatives – e.g. Feng 2010) have been the most popular so far. Their interaction properties can further be translated into small-scale (subgalactic) properties for galactic halos.</p>
                                <p> My current work develops in this very context. My PhD thesis is entitled: Impact of small scale structuring of dark matter on its potential detection and the main goal is to understand, from first principles and without relying a priori on cosmological simulations, how dark matter (sub)halos are distributed in the Universe and what they can tell us about the DM particle nature. My projects are centered around an analytical model for the description of the fine structure of DM that had been optimized to describe the DM distribution in the Milky Way (MW), with an unprecedented level of details (Stref et al. 2017 - SL17 henceforth). It is based on a statistical description of the ensemble of all subhalos and it encompasses all the structures from the largest to the smallest down to e.g. 10−12 M<sub>⊙</sub> (a resolution orders of magnitude beyond the reach of cosmological simulations – Springel et al. 2008). It starts from an initial cosmological distribution with hard-sphere substructures distributed along the total DM profile of the host. Based on a consistent modelling of the different dynamical effects, subhalos are pruned by tidal stripping and destroyed when becoming too small. This model has been a motivation to explore various domains of theoretical high-energy physics at the crossroad between cosmology, particle physics, astrophysics and gravitational dynamics as illustrated by the following (almost) completed projects. For all these studies I have developed my own numerical tools in C++ and python (I only used two available packages: FeynCalc and Healpy). </p>
                                
                                <ul>
                                <li> Subhalo-star encounters at a population level. I incorporated new dynamical gravita- tional effects in the SL17 model by analytically looking at the interactions between subhalos and individual stars laying in the MW disk (Facchinetti et al. in prep.(a)). This had never been done for an entire subhalo population with such thorough care. See Refs. (Berezinsky et al. 2005; Green et al. 2007) and complementary studies using simulations (Delos 2019).</li>
                                <li>  Simulation-free normalization of subhalo populations. In its first version the number of subhalos in the model was calibrated on simulations. Using merger trees algorithms (from excursion set formalism) I produced realistic cosmological mass functions and provided an independant normalization method. This study is inspired from and improved over (Jiang et al. 2014) and is complementary to e.g. (Hiroshima et al. 2018).</li>
                                    <li>  From simplified DM particle models to subhalo properties. I have investigated the relation between particle physics models for DM and their impact on its structuring through a
                                consistent resolution of the kinetic and chemical decoupling equations. I considered DM particle scenarios in which DM is produced thermally, and experiences successively a chemical and then a kinetic decoupling. The kinetic decoupling temperature translates into a free-streaming scale for DM particles, below which small overdensities resulting from inflation are damped, leading to a cutoff/minimal mass for DM (sub)halos (complementary to collisonal damping – Green et al. 2005). My study relies on a generic Lagrangian with scalar, pseudo-scalar, vector and axial-vector interactions between DM and the standard model (SM) particles. Such models are appealing (Abdallah et al. 2015) as they are ajustable to UV complete theories. I computed the free-streaming scale, deduced the minimal subhalo mass and I plugged the result as in input of the SL17 model. That allowed me to observe the impact of the different parameters of the particle model on the subhalo population (Facchinetti et al. in prep.(b)).</li>
                                <li> Galactic subhalo detectability in gamma rays. I used the SL17 model in addition to a realistic Galactic γ-ray foreground model to put constraints for the detection, in the MW, of DM subhalos as γ-rays point sources with the Fermi-LAT and CTA telescopes (Facchinetti et al. in prep.(c), 2020). I determined whether we could detect subhalos before detecting the diffuse DM emission and I evaluated the properties of the most visible ones. This study is complementary to the usual approches analyzing the data from the unidentified point sources detected by the Fermi-LAT, e.g. (Bertoni et al. 2015), or using simulations (Calore et al. 2017).</li> </ul>
                                <p>I am also involved in a project studying a new class of supergravity models (Moultaka et al. 2019) that very roughly gives the N2MSSM in the low-energy limit. There, DM arises as a singlino coupling to the CP-odd Higgs particle that mixes with mesons and may decay into various products. Adapting my numerical tools I will resume the study of the subsequent rich phenomenology. Finally, I am part of a collaboration to better assess the DM signatures in the CMB. This amounts to plug in DM interactions beyond the effective-coupling way, and track more systematically velocity- dependent signatures. Having computed the velocity dependence for the tree-level cross-sections in the aforementioned generic model I am able to provide different examples to test in this framework.</p>
